This specification contains everything needed to fully describe the design including documentation and register descriptions. All downstream views are generated from this single specification.\n","\n","The various benefits and capabilities that IDS provides are described in the following paragraphs.\n","1. DESIGN REUSE \n","\n","Reuse within the company is vital for reducing the overall cost. However, reuse is not just document copy/paste. To be effective, components from all downstream views such as RTL, verification, firmware, drivers, and software must be effectively reused. Typically, engineers in various groups do their own duplication of code if applicable. When all downstream views are generated from a single specification, and the specification is reused (be it by copy/paste or by reference), then the problem of design reuse in the various groups disappears. \n","\n","Sometimes designs are locked to the hardware register bus used, or the registers are spread all over the design without clear boundaries. This hinders RTL reuse since a subsequent generation of the design may use a different register bus or may change the registers. When using IDesignSpec, there is a clear separation between the register implementation and the rest of the design, which enables design reuse. \n","\n","When reusing a design in IDesignSpec, the documentation is reused. Engineers need not spend hours copying and pasting, changing addresses, or re-formatting the register documentation. The documentation is pre-formatted in a standard way that is suitable for reuse.\n","\n","2. ELIMINATE INEFFICIENCIES \n","\n","In a digital design process inefficiencies ensure when a single source of design information is not maintained, and needs to be reentered in different ways and in different formats. This not only makes the team less productive, but also wastes time. \n","\n","Change in the specification/register description leads to changes all over. If the change is not handled in an automated fashion, chaos reigns supreme and quality suffers. \n","\n","The domino effect of changes in hardware design.\n","\n","\n","\n","Often design teams overlook the importance of proper register specification and associated documentation. This leads to non-uniform specifications that are spread out all over the design environment. There is a disconnect between the specifications and the code implemented from these specifications. This also leads to widespread issues with re-usability and efficiency. \n","\n","IDesignSpec is the world‘s first specialized Editor for Systems or SoCs (System on Chips) with intelligence about the design process. The user does not need to learn a new language or get familiar with a new GUI. IDesignSpec has been purposefully designed from the ground up to be a lightweight and user-friendly add-in to any existing design process.\n","\n","\n"," IDesignSpec document screen shot in MS Word.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","IDesignSpec saves the design data in an XML format. This single source is then converted into the various views using XML Transformations. Changes made to the specifications are reflected automatically in the various downstream views.\n"," \n","A single user or a team would use IDesignSpec to describe the design in terms of its functionality and register details. A single editor would be used and multiple files in different formats do not need to be maintained. Data is stored in a human/computer readable XML format, so the user always has direct access to the data. It uses built-in transformations to create a variety of outputs as shown in figure below.\n","\n","\n","\n","Various views generated by IDesignSpecTM\n","\n","\n","\n","3. GENERATE HARDWARE AND TEST BENCH\n","\n","IDesignSpec generates synthesizable logic design code, as well as appropriate verification code. It generates optimal logic design code for the target technology that will work at the target frequency. \n","4. A BETTER APPROACH\n","\n","Other EDA companies have introduced tools to solve the problem described above. However, they are inadequate because they require designers to either learn a new language or a new GUI. In addition, they do not solve the problem of keeping the design documentation in sync with the register description. \n","\n","IDesignSpec enables the designer to naturally describe the specification of the design. This is human and machine readable so that all downstream views can be automatically generated. It provides one complete solution for design, verification and documentation teams. \n","\n","\n","Created with the Personal Edition of HelpNDoc: \n","\n","Basic Concepts\n","Basic Concepts\n","\n","This section explains the basic concept for how IDesignSpec™ works.\n"," shows a typical hardware system – a number of chips with a data I/O bus, and a bus for register access. The chips contain several blocks, each with their own set of registers. The register bus conforms to a standard protocol. Popular protocols include: AMBA, OCP-IP, Wishbone, Avalon, or proprietary. Aspects such as frequency of operation, requirement for burst write and read, and total bandwidth requirements are some of the factors that come into play in choosing the appropriate bus. It is possible that the choice of the register bus may change over time from one generation of product to the next. \n","\n","\n"," Canonical hardware system with configuration/status registers\n","\n","\n","\n","A configuration register may be thought of as being divided into several fields of arbitrary widths, each associated with certain functionality of the design  (see figure ). The fields could individually be read-writable, read-only, write-one-to-clear, or contain fixed values. These fields are logically in the same register, but could be implemented separately in hardware. \n","\n","\n","Typical configuration register with two fields\n","\n","\n","\n","In this section, we take a closer look at the flow of information for a digital design in general, and more specifically the flow of register information through a design process. \n","\n","An architect or hardware engineer typically creates a specification that includes the functionality of the design and register details. All groups involved in the design process need correct, up-to-date, and unambiguous information about the location of these registers specifying their address and purpose. Design groups needs this information for proper design implementation, while verification teams need the same information to verify for the intended purpose. The device driver, diagnostics groups, lab technicians and software application developers need this information in order to properly use the hardware. These groups also need the latest, most up-to-date documentation regarding the register description. This information is typically captured in a document using a text editor or spreadsheet format.  \n","\n","After a specification is written, registers are hand-coded in RTL. The same information is then reentered in the form of C/C++ header files for use in application software, device driver, diagnostics, and firmware.  \n","\n","As the design process progresses and implementation starts, new functionalities are introduced and some of the old ones are modified or eliminated. Each one potentially has the effect of modifying the register location, and adding/modifying/removing the registers and constituent fields and their purposes. \n","Changes to the specifications lead to widespread changes in the various views of these registers. If RTL needs to change, C/C++ code needs to change, hence documentation and even Lab debug instructions need to be updated. \n","\n","\n","\n","Groups dependent on the specification\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","A process where engineers manually read the specification and code the RTL or the C header files is highly undesirable as it is tedious, mundane, and costly in terms of both time and resources. \n","IDesignSpec™ automates this process of generating code from a single specification. Note that a specification may be split over a number of individual documents or files. Further, a specification need not be in Word or Excel, as some teams desire to create these specifications in ASCII Text file formats.\n","\n","\n","\n","Created with the Personal Edition of HelpNDoc: \n","\n","Address Unit\n","Address Unit in IDesignSpec\n","As the name implies, the Address Unit specifies the unit for the numbers related to addresses used in IDS (e.g. offset, addresses, size, etc.) and is NOT the unit of pure numbers such as repeat, default, bits etc.\n","What does Address Unit do?\n","Address Unit changes the interpretation of the specified number. For example, if offset is 0x10 and address unit is 32 then the byte offset is (32/8 = 4) * 0x10 = 0x40.\n","Why use Address Unit?\n","If all address related numbers are specified in bytes, then the user can set Address Unit equal to 8 and everything will be in bytes throughout the spec and outputs with no multiplication.\n","However, some users prefer to specify addresses in terms of the size of the registers. For example for 32 bit registers that are contiguous, the addresses will be 0x0, 0x1, 0x2, … In this case IDS needs to be told that the specified addresses are in terms of 4 bytes, therefore Address Unit is set to 32 bits.\n","Where is Address Unit Specified?\n","Address Unit is specified in different places.\n","IDSWord, IDSExcel, IDSCal, include an address unit configuration radio button. \n","In case of multiple bus domains, each bus may have a different Address Unit. These are specified in the Bus Domain table.\n","In IDSBatch the Address Unit can be specified with -unit on the command line.  The command line option will override the Address Unit configuration specified in the document. In case of multiple bus domains, this option is not used, and the -mbdc option is used.\n","Eg : By default, Address Unit is 8; to change it to 32 requires the following command:\n","  command:   idsbatch example.xls -out verilog -bus apb -unit 32\n","This switch will override any table defined in the document. This switch can also be used to specify bus domains for IP-XACT or SystemRDL files where there is no native way to specify them. Along with -top_property “bus.domain=<bus_name>” the use of this switch can be a very powerful way to create the desired outputs.\n","For the case of a chip level spec with multiple bus domain and references to various blocks (each with their own bus domains) the top level (chip level) bus domain table will override the bus domain table at the block level.\n","For the case where no bus domain is used, the top level (chip) bus domain overrides the the lower level (block) bus domain.\n","Examples: \n","If block BLOCK1 is referenced inside a chip (CHIP1 containing MBD table using APB with Address Unit=32) and this bus domain is used in a referenced block (using APB and Address Unit=16) then the chip-level configuration will override the BLOCK1 APB Address Unit with the current chip domain Address Unit (in this case 32).\n","\n","\n","In case for multiple bus domains, each bus may have a different Address Unit. These are specified in the Bus domain table.\n","\n","\n","In IDSBatch the Address Unit can be specified with -unit on the command line.

The mapping of RegGroup to RTL is addr map. An addr map can be inside another addr map so Reg-group can be inside another RegGroup and can have multi-level hierarchy.The External RegGroup is not implemented by IDesignSpec and need to be implemented manually by setting the \"external\" property as \"true\" in the template. IDesignSpec provides appropriate handshake signals repeatedly, based on the number of registers that are repeated for the external RegGroup to be joined to the hardware logic generated by IDesignSpec:\n","\n","address_out,\n","raddress_out,\n","wr_data_out,\n","<RegGroup>_<reg>_wr_req_in, \n","<RegGroup>_<reg>_rd_ack_in, \n","<RegGroup>_<reg>_rd_data_in, \n","<RegGroup>_<reg>_wr_valid_out, \n","<RegGroup>_<reg>_rd_valid_out, \n","IDSWord\n","\n","\n","\n","IDSExcel\n","\n","\n","\n","For more information refer to section \n","\n","Created with the Personal Edition of HelpNDoc: \n","\n","Alignment\n","Alignment\n","\n","IDesignSpec can generate interface to connect to an external RegGroup (which is implemented as a memory, a register file or a sub-block). In order to optimize the address decoding, the addresses for such external RegGroups should be aligned properly. In other words, the location of these external RegGroups should be such that minimum numbers of LSB address bits are required for address decoding inside these RegGroups. This way the decoding of the RegGroups can be done without expensive comparators.\n","\n","When the external RegGroups are properly aligned, minimum address decode bits are required. In fact, one only needs to compare the address of certain high order address bits for determining if the access to the RegGroup is being made. In case of internal RegGroups (those implemented by IDesignSpec) no such restriction exists since for each register a decode signal is created independently.\n","\n","If external RegGroups are not aligned to proper address boundaries, extra decoding logic including comparators are required.\n","In the interest of encouraging optimized designs, IDesignSpec supports external RegGroups that are properly aligned. If external RegGroups are not properly aligned, suitable error messages are (will be) generated.\n","\n","As an example:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","In the above example, the external memory has 8 address locations. If this memory is located at offset = 0x3, then the address decode required for addressing memory contents will be from 0x3 to 0xA, which requires two comparators.\n","\n","However, if the memory is located at 0x8, only bit 4 and higher need to be checked and only one equality-checker (XOR) will be required.\n","\n","For the above configuration if the memory is located at the offset equal to 0x08 then following RTL will be generated.\n","\n","\n","\n","Note that individual memory locations in an external RegGroup can be addressed by simply using a smaller decoder for the LSB bits of the address. Often times lower order bits of the address bus are directly connected to the address of the external memory.\n","\n","For more information on how to interface external Register group see section \n","\n","Created with the Personal Edition of HelpNDoc: \n","\n","Register Array\n","\n","\n","The UVM Register Array is defined in IDS by creating one register in a register group with repeat count equals to the array size.

A Widget which is essentially a bridge between the register bus selected by the user and an internal bus. \n","2. A decode logic block for decoding the register address \n","3. Logic for all registers and register groups (except those marked \"external\"– see below for more details) \n","4. Read-back mux for reading data back from the registers and \"external\" registers or register groups. \n","5.

The clock domain on the Hardware side can be different from this Bus. \n","\n","\n","Hardware generated by IDesignSpec\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Signal description\n","\n","\n","The various signals are described in this section. In case of RTL outputs, if the Proprietary bus is selected, then all signals interfacing to the widget (bridge) are available as ports on the IDS generated block. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Block Description in IDesignSpec\n","\n","Slave: For each block in the IDesignSpec document, a slave RTL block is created that implements the specified registers. The interface to the selected bus protocol is implemented by a widget. The generated decode logic, read_back_mux, internal registers and some glue logic are all instantiated in the slave rtl block.\n"," \n","Decode Logic: This block accepts the address from the bus through widget and decodes the address based upon automatically generated address locations of the registers by IDesignSpec. The register address decoder decodes the address bits and selects the register enable signals. \n","\n","Priority Decode Logic: This is the decision making block when both hardware and software is trying to write to the registers. In this case, hardware is given high priority for write operation.\n","\n","Internal Registers: These are the internally implemented registers generated by IDesignSpec. \n","\n","External Registers: Registers implemented using memory banks or registers in an external device are called external registers. These registers are not implemented by IDesignSpec and need to be implemented manually. IDesignSpec provides appropriate handshake signals for the external register to be hooked to the hardware logic generated by IDesignSpec. \n","\n","Read back mux: This block receives the read-back data from the various registers and passes it back to the bus. \n","The generated design consists of Block and Register address decode, read-back logic paths, and the registers. As shown in the figure above, the software initiated register access happens through the Register Bus. \n","\n","Widget: This block is the bridge between register bus and the internally implemented registers. It changes the external bus or any other proprietary bus signals to local signals which is then used by the slave. The widget is changed based on the bus available. The IDesignSpec generated hardware is the same but the widget block is instantiated depending upon the bus protocol used. \n","\n","\n","Created with the Personal Edition of HelpNDoc: \n","\n","VHDL\n","VHDL\n","IDS generates two styles of VHDL RTL, one is VHDL standard compliant and other one is VHDLalt2.

CDV combines automatic test generation, self-checking test benches, and coverage metrics to significantly reduce the time spent on verifying a design. \n","\n","The UVM register layer classes are used to create a high-level, object-oriented model for memory-mapped registers and memories in a design under verification (DUV). The UVM register layer defines several base classes that, when properly extended, abstract the read/write operations to registers and memories in a DUV.This abstraction mechanism allows the migration of verification environments and tests from block to system levels without any modifications. It can also  move uniquely named fields between physical registers without requiring modifications in the verification environment or tests. Finally, UVM provides a register test sequence library containing predefined test cases user can use to verify the correct operation of registers and memories in a DUV. \n","\n","A register model is an instance of a register block, which may contain any number of registers, register files,memories, and other blocks. Each register file can contains any number of registers and other register files. Each register contains any number of fields, which mirror the values of the corresponding elements in hardware. \n","\n","For each element in a register model-field, register, register file, memory or block, there is a class instance that abstracts the read and write operations on that element. \n","\n","Consider the following example of a register defined inside the block, in IDSWord (the Word version of IDS). \n","\n","\n","This will create a Register Model containing \"IDS_reg_A\" register inside the \"IDS_blk\" block. IDS_reg_A register class will have the Field name \"Fld_1\" with configurations taken from the above template. \n","\n","\n","Likewise, IDS can generate Register Arrays, Memories, Indirect Access Registers, FIFO Registers and Coverage Models that are supported by the UVM register model in its UVM output. Each one of these will be discussed later. \n","\n","Usage Of Register Model \n","\n","Once the Register Model is generated from the Register Specifications of the DUV (design-under-verification), it is to be tested in the UVM Environment. User can also use RTL (Verilog/VHDL) generated by IDS in the UVM Environment as a DUV.

User can also restrict covergroups generation based on read or write access types using property 'coverage=f.rd', will generate only read access type cover-groups(rd_cg_vals) or 'coverage=f.wr' will generate write access type(wr_cg_vals).

While the OVM is the ideal methodology in which to build the sequences and virtual sequences needed to verify the system, it still needs a way to reach into the DUT and configure the peripheral registers and system memory.

Packaging the“register definitions” in this manner serves to create a clean separation between the register declaration and the use of the register in the OVM verification environment. The properties external, size, and offset can be ignored when using chip. \n","\n","Block\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","The code below shows two cases: \n","1.  a register where the data is basically a bit vector and,\n","\n","2.  a register where the data is partitioned into fields. In order to define a register, the user must define the type of data contained in the register – in the example below we have two types – ethernet_statusreg_t and ethernet_RegGroupname_regname2_t. Once defined, these can be used along with the ovm_register parameterized class. \n","\n","typedefstruct packed { \n"," bit [31:25] field1; \n"," bit [24:7] field2; \n"," bit [6:4] field3; \n"," bit [3:0] field4; \n","} ethernet_statusreg_t; \n","\n","typedefstruct packed { \n","  bit [31:0] Field; \n","} ethernet_RegGroupname_regname2_t; \n","\n","\n","These two types of data define what is needed for the register specialization. \n","Defining a register when the data is a bit vector is shown below: \n","\n","classethernet_statusreg extends ovm_register #(ethernet_statusreg_t); \n","  covergroupethernet_statusreg_cg; \n","   field1 : coverpoint data.field1; \n","   field2 : coverpoint data.field2; \n","   field3 : coverpoint data.field3; \n","   field4 : coverpoint data.field4; \n","  endgroup \n","\n","\n","\n","Functional coverage for a register field may be captured by adding an embedded coverage group in the register type.

This is most easily done using the built-in function add field ()in the ovm_register class. For example, consider the case of a register of type statusreg, which has four fields with different access and default values.

This document describes the Tcl commands that work on the IDesignSpec documents. For example, “Templates” in IDS documents translate into “Objects” in Tcl. The Tcl API introduces 7 object types, each corresponding to a document template, e.g., Property/Value pairs on the templates translate into ‘properties’ within Objects. So for a “block”, the value specified for offset can be accessed by getting the ‘offset’ property of the block object in Tcl.\n","IDS Object Types and their Properties\n","\n","The following types of Objects have been introduced in the Tcl API of IDS. \n","System\n","\n","      System Properties \n","\n","            name : Name of the register after performing following actions:\n"," \n","If ‘Preserve name’ is set in the IDS Configuration, then all spaces are trimmed and then converted to “_” and everything other than underscore, numbers and alphabets is removed.\n"," \n","If ‘Preserve name’ is NOT set in the IDS Configuration, then everything except alphabets and numbers is removed. \n","\n","\n","Board\n","\n","      Board Properties \n","\n","            name : Name of the register after performing following actions:\n"," \n","If ‘Preserve name’ is set in the IDS Configuration, then all spaces are trimmed and then converted to “_” and everything other than underscore, numbers and alphabets is removed.\n"," \n","If ‘Preserve name’ is NOT set in the IDS Configuration, then everything except alphabets and numbers is removed. \n","\n","Chip\n","\n","      Chip Properties \n","\n","            name : Name of the register after performing following actions:\n","\n","If ‘Preserve name’ is set in the IDS Configuration, then all spaces are trimmed and then converted to “_” and everything other than underscore, numbers and alphabets is removed.\n"," \n","If ‘Preserve name’ is NOT set in the IDS Configuration, then everything except alphabets and numbers is removed. \n","\n","\n","            offset :  Its value is in the same unit as defined by the settings in the IDS Configuration. \n","\n","            address :  byte address of the chip. \n","\n","            size :  Total size of the chip.

This is true even when the directive is nested within another template accessed through #parse or located in a velocity macro. The resulting merged output will contain all the content up to the point the #stop directive is encountered. This is handy as an early exit from a template. For debugging purposes, we may provide a message argument (e.g. #stop('$foo was not in context') ) that will be written to the logs upon completion of the stop command.\n","\n","\n","(2) Parse:\n","\n","The #parse script element allows the template designer to import a local file that contains VTL. Velocity will parse the VTL and render the template specified. Like the #include directive, #parse can take a variable rather than a template. Any templates to which #parse refers must be included under TEMPLATE_ROOT. Unlike the #include directive, #parse will only take a single argument.\n","VTL templates can have #parse statements referring to templates that in turn have #parse statements. By default set to 10, the directive.parse.max.depth line of the velocity.properties allows users to customize maximum number of #parse referrals that can occur from a single template.\n","\n","\n","(3) Include:\n","\n","The #include script element allows the template designer to import a local file, which is then inserted into the location where the #include directive is defined. The contents of the file are not rendered through the template engine. For security reasons, the file to be included may only be under TEMPLATE_ROOT.\n","The file to which the #include directive refers is enclosed in quotes. If more than one file will be included, they should be separated by commas. For example, #include( \"one.txt\" ) and #include( \"one.gif\",\"two.txt\",\"three.htm\" ).\n","The file being included need not to be referenced by name; In fact, it is often preferable to use a variable instead of a filename. This could be useful for targeting output according to criteria determined when the page request is submitted. For example, #include( \"greetings.txt\", $seasonalstock ).\n","\n","(4) Set:\n","\n","The #set directive is used for setting the value of a reference. A value can be assigned to either a variable reference or a property reference, and this occurs in brackets, as demonstrated:\n","\n","     #set( $primate = \"monkey\" )\n","     #set( $customer.Behavior = $primate )\n","The left hand side (LHS) of the assignment must be a variable reference or a property reference. The right hand side (RHS) can be one of the following types:\n","\n","     1. Variable reference, e.g., #set( $monkey = $bill ) \n","     2. String literal, e.g., #set( $monkey.Friend = \"monica\" ) \n","     3. Property reference, e.g., #set( $monkey.Blame = $whitehouse.Leak ) \n","     4. Method reference, e.g., #set( $monkey.Plan = $spindoctor.weave($web) ) \n","     5. Number literal, e.g., #set( $monkey.Number = 123 ) \n","     6.

Map, e.g., #set( $monkey.Map = {\"banana\" : \"good\", \"roast beef\" : \"bad\"}) \n","\n","(5) Conditionals:\n","\n","If / ElseIf / Else\n","\n","The #if directive in Velocity allows the text to be included when the web page is generated, on the condition for which the if statement is true. For example: \n","    \n","     #if( $foo )\n","     <strong>Velocity!</strong>\n","     #end\n","     \n","An #elseif or #else element can be used with an #if element.

Next $bar is compared to 6, which is true, so the output is Go South.\n","\n","(6) Loops:\n","\n","Foreach Loop\n","\n","The #foreach element allows for looping. For example:\n","     \n","     #foreach( $product in $allProducts )\n","     <li>$product</li>\n","     #end\n","     \n","     This #foreach loop causes the $allProducts list (the object) to be looped over for all of the products (targets) in the list. Each time through      the loop, the value from $allProducts is placed into the $product variable. The contents of the $allProducts variable is a Vector, a Hashtable      or an Array. The value assigned to the $product variable is a Java Object and can be referenced from a variable as such. \n","\n","\n","Lets say that $allProducts is a Hashtable. If you wanted to retrieve the key values for the Hashtable as well as the objects within the Hashtable, you can use code like this:\n","\n","     #foreach( $key in $allProducts.keySet() )\n","     <li>Key: $key -> Value: $allProducts.get($key)</li>\n","     #end\n","\n","Velocity provides an easy way to get the loop counter so that you can do something like the following:\n","\n","     <table>\n","     #foreach( $customer in $customerList )\n","     <tr><td>$foreach.count</td><td>$customer.Name</td></tr>\n","     #end\n","     </table>\n","\n","If you want to stop looping in a foreach from within your template, you can now use the #break directive to stop looping at any time:\n","\n","     ## list first 5 customers only\n","     #foreach( $customer in $customerList )\n","     #if( $foreach.count > 5 )\n","     #break\n","     #end\n","     $customer.Name\n","     #end\n","\n","\n","Velocity Macros:\n","\n","The #macro script element allows template designers to define a repeated segment of a VTL template. Velocimacros are very useful in a wide range of scenarios both simple and complex. This Velocimacro, created for the sole purpose of saving keystrokes and minimizing typographic errors, provides an introduction to the concept of Velocimacros.\n","\n","    #macro( d )\n","    <tr><td></td></tr>\n","    #end\n","\n","The Velocimacro being defined in this example is d, and it can be called in a manner analogous to any other VTL directive:\n","\n","     #d()\n","\n","When this template is called, Velocity would replace #d() with a row containing a single, empty data cell. If we want to put something in that cell, we can alter the macro to allow for a body:\n","\n","    #macro( d )\n","    <tr><td>$!bodyContent</td></tr>\n","    #end\n","\n","Now, if we call the macro just a bit differently, using #@ before the name and providing a body and #end to the call, then Velocity will render the body when it gets to the $!bodyContent:\n","\n","     #@d()Hello!#end\n","\n","A Velocimacro can also take any number of arguments -- even zero arguments, but when the Velocimacro is invoked, it must be called with the same number of arguments with which it was defined.\n","\n","Velocimacros can be defined inline in a Velocity template, meaning that it is unavailable to other Velocity templates on the same web site. Defining a Velocimacro such that it can be shared by all templates has obvious advantages, i.e., it reduces the need to redefine the Velocimacro on numerous templates, saving work and reducing the chance of error, and ensures that a single change to a macro available to more than one template.\n","\n","Upper and lower case text:\n","\n","There is a function 'toUpperCase()' in velocity Template to Capitalize the text or name.\n","If you want the name or text print in lower case then you can use the function 'toLowerCase()'.\n","\n","For Example-:\n","\n","#set($name=\"hello velocity\"))\n","\n","In Upper case-:$name.toUpperCase()\n","\n","In lower case -:$name.toLowerCase()\n","\n","-- \n","\n","Comments:\n","\n","Comments allows descriptive text to be included that is not placed into the output of the template engine.

Below is an example of a comment in VTL.\n","\n","     ## This is a single line comment.\n","\n","A single line comment begins with ## and finishes at the end of the line.

So for defining the hdl paths of internal registers in a spec containing memories, external and internal registers, another property “hdl_path_internal” is added. This property is used to specify hdl path for internal registers only and if specified on a block level, then the specified path will be prepended to the hdl paths of all registers within that block. But this property will not prepend the path to any external register or memory within that block.

CDV combines automatic test generation, self-checking testbenches, and coverage metrics to significantly reduce the time spent verifying a design.\n","The UVM register layer classes are used to create a high-level, object-oriented model for memory-mapped registers and memories in a design under verification (DUV). The UVM register layer defines several base classes that, when properly extended, abstract the read/write operations to registers and memories in a DUV. This abstraction mechanism allows the migration of verification environments and tests from block to system levels without any modifications. It also can move uniquely named fields between physical registers without requiring modifications in the verification environment or tests. Finally, UVM provides a register test sequence library containing predefined testcases you can use to verify the correct operation of registers and memories in a DUV.\n","A register model is an instance of a register block, which may contain any number of registers, register files, memories, and other blocks. Each register file contains any number of registers and other register files. Each register contains any number of fields, which mirror the values of the corresponding elements in hardware.\n","For each element in a register model—field, register, register file, memory or block—there is a class instance that abstracts the read and write operations on that element.\n","Consider the following example of a register defined inside the block, in IDSWord (the Word version of IDS).\n","\n","\n","This will create a Register Model containing ‘IDS_reg_A’ register inside the ‘IDS_blk’ block.

Each one of these is discussed later.\n","Usage of Register model\n","Once the Register Model is generated from the Register Specifications of the DUV (design-under-verification), it is to be tested in the UVM Environment. User can also use RTL (Verilog/VHDL) generated by IDS in the UVM Environment as a DUV. Design and BUS Interface is created where bus (controlling the traffic of the transactions) signals are connected to the design. This Interface is the Top Level HDL Path.

Hence a separate Datasheet output was constructed. The datasheet output caters to the end-user requirements for information that originates in the spec. \n","\n","\n","There are two major components of the datasheet output. \n","\n","1. The Pre-Processor : which enables the users to selectively include elements of the Specification document. \n","\n","\n","2. The Filters : which enables the users to filter out certain aspects of the Specification document. \n","\n","\n","This document describes the Datasheet output in detail, along with its two core components. \n","\n","\n","Note:\n","When using this feature, any of the IDSWord templates can be used.\n","This feature is currently under beta testing and needs to be further refined. It will be available as a separate add-on to IDSWord.\n","\n","\n","The IDSWord Pre-Processor\n","\n","The Pre-Processor was added to IDesignSpec, in order to give the user the ability to pick and choose the output that is generated from the spec. For example, user may decide to exclude certain proprietary documentation that is alright to share internally but not with the external world. Similarly, a single specification document may contain two or more different versions or different types of device information. The Pre-processor functionality in IDSWord is similar to that found in C/C# compilers. This enables users to group the document into areas that are to be included in the output, or not subject to certain tags being defined or not. \n","\n","The preprocessor directives are :  \n","#include \n","\n","The #include template enables users to include another file which is specified with an absolute or relative path. The included file can have any IDS Template or any other Word content. \n","\n","For example :\n","\n","\n","In the above #include template, paragraph with heading \"Feature A\" will be fetched from the \"Requirement_SetA.docx\" file. The document is included from the specified paragraph, including all the sub-paras or till the end of the document. \t\n","If the paragraph heading is not specified, all contents of the .docx file will be fetched. \n","When \"override=1\", then all the parameters/defines in the define template of the included document gets overridden with the values of the respective parameters/defines in the current document. By default override=1.  \n","\n","Note that if the paragraph heading is specified, the file that is included cannot have \"#include\" template in it.\n","\n","\n","#ifdef, #elseif, #else, #endif \n","\n","This is the primary template to choose the content. \n","\n","\n","It is possible to use tags in the #ifdef template. These tags should be already defined in the \"Define template\" or \"Variant template\". The values of the tags can be any string, integer or any boolean expression. If the values of the tags are non-zero(true), they are considered to be set and the code corresponding to it will appear in the output.\n","\n","Similarly other templates are also provided. \n","\n","\n","                                      \n","                                      \n","\n","Note 1 : The NOT operator can also be used. E.g. !Enable_feature2. \n","\n","Note 2 : It is perfectly legal to start another #ifdef - #endif inside an #ifdef. \n","\n","\n","Overriding Parameters\n"," \t\t\t\t\n","\n","1. If \"private\" property is set to \"1\" for a parameter/define in the define template in the included document, then the parameter/define takes the value defined in that template and use it wherever required in the included document. But if private is set to \"0\" or left empty, then the parameter/define gets overridden with their corresponding values from the top document.\n","\n","2. If \"private\" property is set to \"0\" or left empty in the included document and \"override\" property is set \"0\" in the #include template in the top document, parameters values will not be overridden. \n","\n","3. Parameters/Defines/Variants can be used anywhere in the current document by specifying Parameters/Defines/Variants names within '#' without any space.\n","Eg. The define \"IP_NAME\" in the above define template can be used anywhere in the document as #IP_NAME# and it will get replaced with its value \"GIG_ONLY_CHIP\" in the datasheet output.\n","\n","NOTE:- Names starting with a $ in the define template are parameters and without $ are defines. There is no difference between them in datasheets, but have difference in IDS register Spec.\n","\n","\n","Datasheet Settings\n","\n","To open Datasheet setting click on \"Configure\" button in IDS toolbar -> click on \"DataSheet\" tab.\n","\n","Following settings are possible for datasheet output:\n","1. If \"Remove Define/Variant table\" is checked, all the define and variant tables are removed from the datasheet output.   \n","2. If \"Remove Preoperties\" is checked, all the properties specified in curly braces in specification will be removed from datasheet output.\n","3. \"Datasheet output file name\" is used to specify the datasheet output file name. By default output file name will be \"currentFileName_datasheet.docx\" \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Information Flow \n","\n","Once a document has been created with the IDS Preprocessor directives, based on the user section of tags, appropriate intermediate file is created. This file is then processed by the IDSWord engine that interprets the information in its templates. Next, the register address information is back annotated to the original spec document and a Table of Content is inserted if required. Note that the other derivative outputs are generated from the intermediate file. In case there are errors in the generation of the final outputs, an error message is generated. \n","\n","Note the difference between variants and preprocessor directives. \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Datasheet Filters \n","\n","It is now possible to generate datasheets after filtering the content and making the output look better, and more like a datasheet and less like an engineering specification. Filters are applied to the intermediate document and then the output datasheet is created. \n","\n","Here are the possible filters available : \n","\n","Hide Properties \n","\n","This option enables users to hide the properties in the output. These properties, if not hidden may appear like this : {rtl.hw_w1p=true}, although these properties are useful for the team that is creating the various register models, they are probably not useful for the end customer interested in the datasheet. \n","\n","Note that this option does not eliminate the properties, so that if the end-user wants, they can still generate register models from the datasheet. \n","\n","Expand All RegGroups \n","\n","A regGroup is a concise way to capture a group of registers or other regGroups that may be repeated many times in the address space. Often the datasheet should explicitly spell out all the registers with different names. This options will expand all regGroups. \n","\n","Note that it is also possible to use #1, #2 etc in the name of the register so that the expanded name can have the proper iterator. \n","\n","\n","Flatten refs \n","\n","The references in the document can be flattened, which means that all content from the referenced document is brought into the main document so that a single document (the datasheet) has the complete information.\n","\n","\n","Replace templates \n","\n","The default IDS templates are useful for capturing the user specifications. They may not be very well suited for datasheet information which needs to be more concise. With this option the user can opt to change the templates in the output. Note however that after such a change, the end-user may not be able to use IDS to generate register models. However, the user can choose to show only useful properties in the template that make the best use of the available space in the datasheet. \n","\n","Summary \n","IDesignSpec is a complete tool for capturing specification.

An interrupt is a signal generated and sent to the processor by hardware or software indicating an event that needs attention. The processor responds to it by suspending its current activities, saving its state, executing a program called an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) to deal with the event. The event is temporary and after the completion of Interrupt Service Routine, the processor resumes execution from previous saved state.\n","\n","Not only an interrupt signal, designs, also need \"halt signals\" to halt the processor (i.e idle state) at its normal execution of program, until the next interrupt is fired. Mostly in debugging the processor , halt signal is/are generated by external devices. \n","\n","For designs to generate interrupt signal, it must contain a set of registers that provides some logic for generating interrupts. These register have been identified as status, pending, enable and mask register. This document describes these registers, how to specify them in IDesignSpec and what gets generated as a result.\n","\n","Interrupt Channels\n","\n","Central to dealing with interrupts in hardware is the concept of Interrupt Channels. An interrupt channel is nothing but a bit position in a register which denotes an event. The bit position for the event remains the same in all interrupt registers.  It is recommended that the name of the bit be same in all registers. A channel formed by interrupt signal is as shown below. Note that there is one to one correspondence in each channel. Fifth source signal will update only 5th bit of status and it is allowed to propagate further only if 5th bit of enable is high. The last step is OR of all the channel bits in pending, in case pending is present in design. In case if pending is not present, then output will be an OR of ANDing of the status and enable bits of each channel.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Note: Likewise halt signal is generated from channels of status and halt enable/ halt mask registers defined below.\n","\n","Interrupt Management Registers\n","\n","Pending register – Pending register is originally the Logical And of interrupt source & enable field. Interrupt source can be registered in a flip flop or it can be a signal. Pending register has been used in two different contexts with the same basic principles. \n","\n","1. In one context pending register will have interrupt set only if interrupt source signals (not registered) & enable register are both high as shown in . In case, if firmware needs to acknowledge/clear interrupt, it does so by writing 1 to pending register or by reading from it. These types of interrupt are known as sticky interrupt where sw needs to clear the interrupt. In case if interrupts are just entering the block , and there is no provision of clearing those interrupt, those are known as NonSticky Interrupts . Pending register are by default sticky . It can be made nonsticky by using property intr.nonsticky= 1 at register or field\n","    \n","It can be identified using property intr.pending at register or field\n","    \n","\n","2.

In this case if firmware needs to acknowledge/clear interrupt it writes one to status register or clear by reading from it.\n","\n","\n","Status register - When interrupt source is asserted or detected for edge it writes 1 to status register.

It can be identified using property intr.mask at register or field\n","\n","\n","Post register – Post fields are used to register interrupts driven by software.

IDesignSpec is a specification driven system that targets FPGAs and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for Intellectual Property (IP) and System on Chip (SoC).  This document details the integration between IDesignSpec and Xilinx tools. \n","This integration enables users to have an uninterrupted flow of information from the specification to the bitstream, helping create a more efficient development methodology.\n","\n","The Problem of Addressable Registers\n","Hardware designs with configuration and status registers that are addressable by a register bus such as AXI4LITE are very common. Manually creating registers in RTL, then verifying them using the popular Universal Verification Methodology (UVM), creating the other artifacts and code fragment for firmware is tedious and error prone.\n","The RTL can be automatically generated with a register generation tool however, the problem of integration with rest of the application logic still remains. Manual integration is again time consuming and prone to errors when the specification changes. \n","Vivado’s interface offers a good solution in this integration process. However, files need to be generated such that the integration is possible without any hiccups along the way.\n","\n","Existing flows for Xilinx FPGA\n","\n","The Vivado design flow comprises of the following steps: design entry, design synthesis and design implementation.

Initial release.\n","Introduction\n","IDesignSpec is a powerful tool for entry of SoC register specification using GUI and/or text-based descriptions.  A register description may be entered in several formats including Microsoft Word (IDSWord add-on), IDSExcel (IDSExcel add-on), IP-XACT, YAML, and SystemRDL (IDSBatch mode), or combinations of multiple formats.\n","\n","This application note will describe the entry of several small, simple register descriptions where IDesignSpec will generate several ports that connect with the user application logic for each example.  The target audience is engineers with basic understanding of the IDesignSpec tool flow, and who wish to understand more about the inclusion of hardware-side ports generated by the tool, and where these ports connect to the application logic.  Some hardware-side ports are explicitly defined in a signal list, while others are inferred by the inclusion of a signal name in a property or where the port names are derived from register and/or register field names.\n","\n","The ports that can be generated by IDesignSpec include:\n","Ports corresponding to register hardware-side access type.\n","Direct connections of explicitly defined signals, including secondary resets.\n","Clock-domain crossing clock inputs.\n","Ports needed to utilize RTL properties, such as enables and pulse outputs.\n","External registers connections (as specified by the user) where such external registers are the responsibility of the user to implement and connect to the IDesignSpec generated RTL.\n","Memory connections, where memory logic is external to the register RTL by definition.\n","Application Logic Port Generation by Source\n","Ports generated from Signals template\n","\n","Specific ports may be specified in a Signals template.  The ports will be connected to registers and/or special logic via the use of properties such as “next”, “rtl_wrapper”, or “resetsignal”.\n","\n","\n","\n","Logic Ports Generated for HW access type \n","\n","The choice of hardware access types in register descriptions will determine which ports are generated by IDesignSpec for each register/field.  There are 3 hardware access types: read/write (RW), read-only (RO), and write-only (WO) which describe how the application logic can access individual register fields.  These are the most common type of ports connected to application logic.\n","\n","\n","\n","Clock-Domain Crossing clock ports\n","\n","When the {cdc.clock=<clock_signal>} property is implemented in a field/reg in IDSWord/IDSExcel or with (cdc_clock = \"<clock_signal>\") UDP is set in SystemRDL, the clock signal name is inferred from the definition and added to the port list in the HDL output.  This clock will be used to synchronize the output with the specified clock.  The user must connect this clock when instantiating the generated RTL block.\n","\n","\n","\n","RTL properties that generate ports\n","\n","There are several RTL properties that create input ports to enable/disable HW updating of registers/fields, create output ports for register enables, and that create ports to output a pulse that occurs on specific read or writes to the registers/fields.\n","\n","\n","External registers and memories\n","\n","There is an option in register/block templates to utilize register or memories as external to the IDesignSpec generated RTL blocks.  IDesignSpec will create external ports to connect to these external register/memory implementations.\n","IDesignSpec considers all memories connected to the register map to be external and generates its corresponding hardware ports..  There is a memory template in IDSWord as well as a memory header in IDSExcel.\n","\n","All external memories and registers in a block will share the same write_data input provided by the block.  However, each external component will receive its own write enable signal.  Memories will also be connected to an address bus, and it is advised to set an offset where the lowest address will be all 0’s (for avoiding the use of comparators during the address decode stage).\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","The timing information of external registers is explained in the following:\n","\n","\n","Generating HDL Outputs\n","\n","In IDSWord or IDSExcel, the outputs are generated by selecting the desired file types in Configuration Settings (click on Configure) in the IDesignSpec ribbon under Registers > Outputs, clicking the “Check” button in the IDesignSpec ribbon, and finally clicking on the “Generate” button to produce outputs.  In this example the outputs are Verilog-1995 and VHDL-alt1, and the output directory uses the default name (ids):\n","\n","\n","\n","IDSBatch can accept several input formats, including previously created IDSWord or IDSExcel graphical representations, as well as text-based inputs such as SystemRDL (including version 2.0).  The IDSBatch command line must specify a top-level argument, which in this case could be a chip or a block (e.g. “OurBlock”).  The following command line arguments will generate both Verilog-1995 using the AMBA-AHB bus: \n","\n",">idsbatch OurBlockDesign.rdl  -top OurBlock -out “verilog” -bus amba -rdl_version 2\n",">idsbatch OurBlockDesign.docx -top OurBlock -out “verilog” -bus amba\n",">idsbatch OurBlockDesign.xlsx -top OurBlock -out “verilog” -bus amba\n","Register specification examples and their generated HDL Outputs\n","\n","Note: The formatting (including relocation of comment lines) of some output snippets have been modified for readability, but syntax has not been modified.\n","Signal template connected to register bits\n","\n","IDesignSpec accepts signal port lists in several input formats including SystemRDL, IDSWord, and IDSExcel.  These signals may be used for various operations including outputting error bits or directly outputting register bits.  Signals may also be defined to connect to user logic via the “rtl_wrapper” property.\n","\n","For SystemRDL, ports are created as signals, with their behavior specified in the signal description:\n","// Signals\n","    signal { activelow;\n","             sync;\n","             signalwidth = 1; \n","             desc= \"Output via a single register\";\n","             next = bit_one;\n","           } bit_one_out;\n","    signal { activelow;\n","             sync;\n","             signalwidth = 1; \n","             desc= \"Output via a single register\";\n","             next = bit_zero;\n","           } bit_zero_out;\n","   \n","\n","    signal { activelow;\n","             sync;\n","             signalwidth = 1; \n","             desc= \"Soft reset to connect via resetsignal property\";\n","           } reset0;\n","    signal { activelow;\n","             sync;\n","             signalwidth = 1; \n","             desc= \"Secondary soft reset for resetsignal property\";\n","           } reset1;\n",". . . .\n","  reg Direct_bit { \n","     regwidth = 32;\n","    field {\n","      hw = rw;\n","      sw = rw;\n","      desc = \"Can be directly written by HW or SW\"; \n","    } bit_zero[0:0] = 1'h0;\n","    field {\n","      hw = r;\n","      sw = rw;\n","      desc = \"Can be directly written by HW only\"; \n","    } bit_one[1:1] = 1'h0;\n","  };\n","  . . . .\n","  reg OurReg_w_soft_reset { \n","     regwidth = 32;\n","    field {\n","      hw = rw;\n","      sw = rw;\n","      resetsignal = reset0;\n","      desc = \"Single active-low soft reset.\n","              Default is for reset value all\n","              zeros, synchronous, active-low.\"; \n","          } OurField_sr_low[7:0] = 8'h0;\n","    field {\n","      hw = rw;\n","      sw = rw;\n","      resetsignal = reset1:0x00:sync:high;\n","      desc = \"Single active-high synchronous soft reset\"; \n","          } OurField_sr_high[15:8] = 8'h0;\n","    field {\n","      hw = rw;\n","      sw = rw;\n","      resetsignal = reset0:0xAAAA:sync:low,reset1:0x5555:sync:high;\n","      desc = \"Dual active-low then active-high soft resets\"; \n","          } OurField_sr_low_high[31:16] = 16'h0;\n","\n","  };\n","\n","In IDSWord there is a Signals template/table where signals are defined.

In different flavours of IDesignSpec i.e. IDS Word, IDS Excel and IDS Cal, bus width can be selected in Configure->Bus Width. While in IDS Batch, there is option “-bus_width <8|16|32|64>”. In addition to this, we also confirm that the regwidth of registers should be a multiple of the bus width.
